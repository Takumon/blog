/**
 * A description of a set of changes to a file tree to be made as part of
 * a git commit, modeled as zero or more file `additions` and zero or more
 * file `deletions`.
 *
 * Both fields are optional; omitting both will produce a commit with no
 * file changes.
 *
 * `deletions` and `additions` describe changes to files identified
 * by their path in the git tree using unix-style path separators, i.e.
 * `/`.  The root of a git tree is an empty string, so paths are not
 * slash-prefixed.
 *
 * `path` values must be unique across all `additions` and `deletions`
 * provided.  Any duplication will result in a validation error.
 *
 * ### Encoding
 *
 * File contents must be provided in full for each `FileAddition`.
 *
 * The `contents` of a `FileAddition` must be encoded using RFC 4648
 * compliant base64, i.e. correct padding is required and no characters
 * outside the standard alphabet may be used.  Invalid base64
 * encoding will be rejected with a validation error.
 *
 * The encoded contents may be binary.
 *
 * For text files, no assumptions are made about the character encoding of
 * the file contents (after base64 decoding).  No charset transcoding or
 * line-ending normalization will be performed; it is the client's
 * responsibility to manage the character encoding of files they provide.
 * However, for maximum compatibility we recommend using UTF-8 encoding
 * and ensuring that all files in a repository use a consistent
 * line-ending convention (`\n` or `\r\n`), and that all files end
 * with a newline.
 *
 * ### Modeling file changes
 *
 * Each of the the five types of conceptual changes that can be made in a
 * git commit can be described using the `FileChanges` type as follows:
 *
 * 1. New file addition: create file `hello world\n` at path `docs/README.txt`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 * 2. Existing file modification: change existing `docs/README.txt` to have new
 *    content `new content here\n`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("new content here\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 * 3. Existing file deletion: remove existing file `docs/README.txt`.
 *    Note that the path is required to exist -- specifying a
 *    path that does not exist on the given branch will abort the
 *    commit and return an error.
 *
 *        {
 *          "deletions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt"
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 *
 * 4. File rename with no changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
 *    previous content `hello world\n` to the same content at
 *    `newdocs/README.txt`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "deletions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *            }
 *          ],
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 *
 * 5. File rename with changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
 *    previous content `hello world\n` to a file at path
 *    `newdocs/README.txt` with content `new contents\n`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "deletions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *            }
 *          ],
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("new contents\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
